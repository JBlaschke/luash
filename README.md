# sh (formerly called luash)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zserge/luash.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/zserge/luash)

Tiny library for shell scripting with Lua (inspired by
[Python's sh module](https://pypi.org/project/sh/)). This is a rewrite of
[luash](https://github.com/zserge/luash) to use Lua's POSIX bindings
[luaposix](https://luarocks.org/modules/gvvaughan/luaposix) for process
execution and piping. This version also includes an implementation of `cd`,
`pushd`, and `popd`.

## Install

Via luarocks:

```
luarocks install sh
```

Or just clone this repo and copy sh.lua into your project.

## Simple usage

Every command that can be called via os.execute (except shell builtins -- more
on that later) can be used a global function.  All the arguments passed into the
function become command arguments.

``` lua
local sh = require('sh')
sh.install() -- make shell bindings available to the global namespace

local wd = tostring(pwd()) -- calls `pwd` and returns its output as a string

local files = tostring(ls('/tmp')) -- calls `ls /tmp`
for f in string.gmatch(files, "[^\n]+") do
	print(f)
end
```

Note that `sh.install()` is needed to make all shell comamnds into global
functions. If `sh.install()` is omitted, then the `sh` namespace remains
isolated to the module. In that case, you can call any shell comman using
`sh.<command name>(<args>)` (e.g. `sh.pwd()`).

## Command input and pipelines

If command argument is a table which has a `__input` field - it will be used as
a command input (stdin). Multiple arguments with input are allowed, they will
be concatenated.

The each command function returns a structure that contains the `__input`
field, so nested functions can be used to make a pipeline.

Note that the commands are not running in parallel (because Lua can only handle
one I/O loop at a time). So the inner-most command is executed, its output is
read, the the outer command is execute with the output redirected etc.

``` lua
local sh = require('sh')
sh.install()

local words = 'foo\nbar\nfoo\nbaz\n'
local u = uniq(sort({__input = words})) -- like $(echo ... | sort | uniq)
print(u) -- prints "bar", "baz", "foo"
```

Pipelines can be also written as chained function calls. Lua allows to omit
parens, so the syntax really resembles unix shell:

``` lua
-- $ ls /bin | grep $filter | wc -l

-- normal syntax
wc(grep(ls('/bin'), filter), '-l')
-- chained syntax
ls('/bin'):grep(filter):wc('-l')
-- chained syntax without parens
ls '/bin' : grep(filter) : wc '-l'
```

**Important**: All function calls after a `:` occur inside of the `sh` module.
*Thus, if `sh` hasn't been installed into the global namespace, then `sh` must
*be pre-pended to _only the first_ function call in a "pipe". E.g. the last
*statement in the example above becomes:

```lua
local sh = require('sh')
-- note: __not__ calling `sh.install()`
sh.ls '/bin' : grep(filter) : wc '-l'
```

## Command output can be concatenated using `..`

Output from commands can be concatenated using the `..` operator:

```lua
print("I am: "..whoami())
print(ls "-l":wc "-l".." files/folders found!")
```

## Partial commands and commands with tricky names

You can use `sh.command` to construct a command function, optionally
pre-setting the arguments:

``` lua
local sh = require('sh')

local truecmd = sh.command('true') -- because "true" is a Lua keyword
local chrome = sh.command('google-chrome') -- because '-' is an operator

local gittag = sh.command('git', 'tag') -- gittag(...) is same as git('tag', ...)

gittag('-l') -- list all git tags
```

`sh` can be used as a function as well, it's an alias to `sh.command()`

## Return type

Every command returns a table with: `__stdout`, `__stderr`, `__input`,
`__exitcode`, and `__signal`. The table also has metatable fields `__index`,
`__tostring`, and __concat. These always exist, and allow chaining using the
`:` operator. `__input` is used for command chaining -- a command that is
"neutral" (like `cd`) will pass all inputs through, while the usual POSIX pipe
is accomplished by setting `__input` to `__stdout` from the previous command.

## Accessing `stdout` and `stderr`

The `__stdout` and `__stderr`  contain stdout and stderr. Accessing them
directly can yield messy code -- so the `sh.stdout(cmd)` and `sh.stderr(cmd)`
commands exist to allo for cleaner code. These simply return the corresponding
field -- eg. `sh.stdout(cmd) = cmd.__stdout`.

## Exit status and signal values

Each command function returns a table with `__exitcode` and `__signal` fields.
Those hold the exit status and signal value as numbers. Zero exit status means
the command was executed successfully.

SInce `f:close()` returns exitcode and signal in Lua 5.2 or newer - this will
not work in Lua 5.1 and current LuaJIT.

## Command arguments as a table

Key-value arguments can be also specified as argument table pairs:

```lua
require('sh')
sh.install()

-- $ somecommand --format=long --interactive -u=0
somecommand({format="long", interactive=true, u=0})
```
It becomes handy if you need to toggle or modify certain command line argumnents
without manually changing the argumnts list.

## Managing Errors

By default, whenever a command returns an error (i.e. a non-zero `__exitcode`,
or a shell command set `status` to non-zero) then `sh` will raise the error. For
example, the program:

```lua
local sh = require "sh"
sh.asdf()
```

Will throw an error (assuming the `asdf` is not a valid program):

```
lua: ./sh.lua:307: lua: ./sh.lua:101: execp() failed
stack traceback:
	[C]: in function 'assert'
	./sh.lua:101: in upvalue 'popen3'
	./sh.lua:151: in upvalue 'pipe_simple'
	./sh.lua:302: in field 'asdf'
	test.lua:3: in main chunk
	[C]: in ?
```

This behaviour can be controlled by setting `sh.__raise_errors` to false -- the
error will be ingored (and passed to the `__exitcode` and `__stderr` return
fields). For example, the program:

```lua
local sh = require "sh"
sh.__raise_errors = false
local cmd = sh.asdf()
print(cmd)
```

Now doesn't throw and error (it exits normally), and prints the error message
instead:

```
O: 
E: lua: ./sh.lua:101: execp() failed
stack traceback:
	[C]: in function 'assert'
	./sh.lua:101: in upvalue 'popen3'
	./sh.lua:151: in upvalue 'pipe_simple'
	./sh.lua:302: in field 'asdf'
	test.lua:3: in main chunk
	[C]: in ?
1
```

## Changing Directories

`sh.cd(dir_name)` changes the current directory to `dir` (using `posix.chdir`).
It can be chained using the `:` command. Eg.

```lua
local sh = require "sh"
sh.cd("tests") : ls() : print()
```

Note: the `sh.cd` command does return a metatable with an `__index` function,
the same way as any other `sh` functions, but it passes `__input` thought --
acting as a neutral step of a "pipe".

`sh` also emulates `pushd` and `popd` -- again using `posix.chdir` but keeping
track of the stack of directories visited (using `sh.PUSHD_STACK`). E.g. the program:

```lua
local sh = require "sh"
print("-- 1")
sh.pwd() : print()
print("-- 2")
sh.pushd("tests") : pwd() : print()
print("-- 3")
sh.popd() : pwd() : print()
```

Has the output:

```
-- 1
/home/luash
-- 2
/home/luash/tests
-- 3
/home/luash
```

Note how `sh.popd()` returns to the previous directory. This way `pushd` and
`popd` can be used to bracket commands -- eg:

```lua
sh.pushd(my_dir) : my_cmd(my_args) : popd()
```

## Questions

### The Lua Language Server Doesn't Recognize Shell Commands

You're using the [Lua Language Server](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server)
within your favorite editor, but some `sh` commands still show up as incorrect?
There are two possible solutions: i) you need to install `lsf`

```
luarocks install luafilesystem
```

and; ii) the lua lanague server support currently is a little buggy.

### Does this work on Windows?

Nope -- `sh` currently uses `posix.execp` and `posix.fork` to execute external
commands. So you should probably give WSL or cygwin a try. The problem is that I
don't have access to a Windows machine (nor do I have any experience with
Windows...). If you need Windows support, please leave an issue with this
request. I am also happy to work with any Windows experts. My theory is that
`ex.spawn` from [lua-ex](https://github.com/luaforge/lua-ex) would be a portable
solution.

### Why the rewrite?

[luash](https://github.com/zserge/luash) is great! But the main problem is that:
I was missing `cd` support, as well as seperate pipes for `stdout` and `stderr`.
Also -- and more importantly -- the original `luash` stores the intermediate
results in a `:` "pipe" to a temporary file. I planned to use this to coordinate
scripts on a shared system, where stdout and stderr can contain priviledged
information. A crash before any temporary files are cleaned up could leak
private information.
